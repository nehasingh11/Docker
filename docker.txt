1. Why use Docker ?
Docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies 

2. What is Docker ?
Docker is a platform or ecosystem around creating and running containers.
Docker ecosystem has:
Docker client, Docker server, Docker machine, Docker images, Docker Hub, Docker compose 

3. What is image ?
Single file with all the dependencies and config required to run a program. It has File System Snapshot and Startup command. 

4. What is Container ?
Instance of an image. Runs a program. It has its own storage, networking, memory. 

5. Docker Client (Docker CLI) - Tool that we are going to issue commands to 
Docker Server (Docker Daemon) - Tool that is responsible for creating images, running containers, etc. 

6. Test the following command: To create and run a container from an image. 
  docker run hello-world

  Output:

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
